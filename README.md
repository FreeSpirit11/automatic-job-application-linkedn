# Automatic Job Application LinkedIn

Automate job applications on LinkedIn using Selenium. This Python script signs in, searches for jobs, and applies for them, simplifying the job hunting process.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the script on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver (Ensure it matches your Chrome browser version)
- Chrome Browser

You can install Selenium using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Modify the following variables in the script to match your LinkedIn credentials and job preferences:

    - `USERNAME`: Your LinkedIn email or username.
    - `PASSWORD`: Your LinkedIn password.
    - `DESIRED_JOB`: The type of job you're looking for.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python  main.py
```

4. Manually solve any CAPTCHA that might appear during the process.

5. The script will open LinkedIn, sign in, search for jobs, and apply for easy-to-apply positions.

6. Monitor the script's progress and take actions as necessary.

### Notes

- This script is designed to automate LinkedIn job applications, but it may not work for all job listings, especially if the website structure changes. Please use it responsibly.
